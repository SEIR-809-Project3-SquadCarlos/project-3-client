/*
import React, and React Hooks:
useState, useHistory, useEffect, 

import Links from react router dom

State: variables that update as the user makes changes
an array called attractions
Props: variables that are immutable (they don't change);


when Home mounts, we'll run our useEffect to:
    FETCH our attractions from the api!
    STORE the attractions in a an array.

Our useEffect won't need to update.

functions:
   onClick function that handles the logic for any buttons being clicked.

we're going to RETURN:
list of attractions
maping thru the attractions array, and showing each attraction 
we want to see each attractions detail by clicking on a attraction - we'll use Links to do it.

we want to be able to add/delete attractions by clicking on a button, or perhaps a Link. 
    
STRETCH -- 
we want to be able to search for attractions from the attractions array by different properties
